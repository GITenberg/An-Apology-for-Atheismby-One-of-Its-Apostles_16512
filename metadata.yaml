description: It would be absurd to doubt that religion has an important bearing on
  all the relations and conditions of life. The connexion between religions faith
  and political practice is, in truth, far closer than is generally thought. Public
  opinion has not ripened into a knowledge that religious error is the intangible
  but real substratum of all political injustice. Though the 'schoolmaster' has done
  much, there still remain and hold some away among us, many honest and energetic
  assertors of 'the rights of man, ' who have to learn that a people in the fetters
  of superstition, can never achieve political.
